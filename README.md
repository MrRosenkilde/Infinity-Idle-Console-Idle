# InfinityNumber-ConsoleIdle
A small proof of concept implementation of an idle game running in the console, using my InfinityNumber class.

This small program demonstrates a use of my InfinityNumber class, and the game itself is a proof of concept of how you can make a game run in the Console.

The InfinityNumber class is created as a number type that can do basic arithmetic operations like plus, minus, multiplication, division, and powers without being constraint to a set number of bytes.
