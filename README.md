# InfinityNumber-ConsoleIdle
A small proof of concept implementation of an idle game running in the console, using my InfinityNumber class.

The InfinityNumber project is the main project of the repository, and the Console Idle game is a demonstration of one use case for the InfinityNumber class. 
The InfinityNumber project is meant to be a number type that can do basic arithmetic operations like plus, minus, multiplication, division, and powers without being constrainted to a set number of bytes.

The repository is intended to be build with Visual Studio.
